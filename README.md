# Intent-Classification-Using-RNN-encoder-and-decoder-
Intent classification of sentence given input by user using RNN encoder decoder model.

In this project, I have a dataset consisting of two columns, where first column is user sentence and second
consist of its intent. I have used RNN encoder-decoder model and trained it on given dataset for classification 
of intent given sentence as a input. 

With this model, I was able to get an accuracy of 99.1%
